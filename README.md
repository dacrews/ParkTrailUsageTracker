The landing page features a map and sidebars. One sidebar contains the purpose for the tracker while the the other two contain the visitor form and visitor statistics.

Once the user records their visit, statistics are displayed using a bar chart that quantifies total visits and categorizes them by activity. Statistics are updated each time a new visit is recorded. Visits are displayed as color-coded points and a single marker (while adding a new visit). More statistics to come.

There are several tools that can be used to manipulate how the map is displayed. Along the left side of the screen, there are zoom controls, toggle buttons for the sidebars, and a "World View" button which changes the basemap.
